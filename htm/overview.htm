<h1>2 - General Overview</h1>

<p>VideoRay RI CoPilot provides the latest generation of SMART software tools in a simple to use, pilot-friendly form. Training using VideoRay RI CoPilot is painless and the intuitive tools help novice users tackle even the most complex operations.</p>

<p>VideoRay RI CoPilot automates the VideoRay Pro 4 MicroROV control process. The ROV can efficiently maneuver through a mission, automatically reducing the consideration of the effects of currents. The ROV can also take better quality video pictures due to the improved stability when using VideoRay RI CoPilot.</p>

<p>Pilots normally control a VideoRay ROV using thruster inputs to follow a desired course and speed. Constant adjustments are required to correct the course and account for water current and tether drag. Using VideoRay RI CoPilot, operators are able to identify objects suitable for tracking and can then maintain a stable heading and range to the target as desired, without the concern of current and tether drag. Pilots using the Pro 4 ROV equipped with VideoRay RI CoPilot will be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p></p>hold position and heading at the touch of a button;</li>
  <li><p></p>change the position and heading accurately using a simple point-and-click interface;</li>
  <li><p></p>use the ROV joystick intuitively, without having to consider currents and tether effects;</li>
  <li><p></p>cruise at a constant speed and heading;</li>
  <li><p></p>generate accurate waypoint requests by entering specific coordinates;</li>
  <li><p></p>plan detailed missions by simply selecting a series of waypoints with the mouse;</li>
  <li><p></p>load a vector map of the area; and</li>
  <li><p></p>concentrate on the operations and not actual action of piloting;</li>
  <li><p></p>visualize current field of view as captured by the sonar;</li>
  <li><p></p>track and hold position relative to a selected target;</li>
  <li><p></p>alter the colormap of the interface to suit personal preference and current conditions;</li>
  </ul>

<h2>2.1 Requirements</h2>

<p>VideoRay RI CoPilot requires that the Pro 4 ROV is equipped with a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) and a BlueView P900 Sonar.</p>
 
<h2>2.2 Dynamic Positioning System</h2>

<p>A dynamic positioning (DP) system allows the ROV to automatically hold a requested position. A DP system mimics automatically what a pilot would do in adjusting the thrusters to keep the desired position.</p>

<p>The pilot can easily control the ROV using the DP system. For example, if the pilot maneuvers the joystick to the forwards position, the ROV will move forwards whilst automatically compensating for cross-currents and tether effects. 
VideoRay RI CoPilot enables object relative station-keeping and approach; the system will maintain a constant range to target whilst keeping the target at the center of the sonar field of view. The user can then perform object-relative advances / retreats (reduce or increase range to target); or change depth/altitude while keeping a constant distance from the target.</p>

<h2>2.3 VideoRay RI CoPilot Core Features</h2>

<P>The core features of VideoRay RI CoPilot are:.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p></p><b>Pilot Interface</b>: The VideoRay RI CoPilot pilot interface offers the visual aid of real-time monitoring. Its non-intrusive dark background enhances the display on screen and allows the user to extract vital real-time information for piloting.
  <li><p></p><b>Hover Command</b>: This command provides station-keeping at the touch of a button.</li>
  <li><p></p><b>Autohover Flight Mode</b>: In this mode the ROV switches automatically between MANUAL mode (when the joystick is in use) and HOVER (when the joystick is not in use).</li>
  <li><p></p><b>Autofly Flight Mode</b>: In this mode the ROV can be controlled through the enhanced joystick velocity controller or through the Click & Go interface. This mode also enables the alternative navigation tools of the Survey Module.</li>
  <li><p></p><b>Cruise Flight Mode</b>: In this mode the ROV can be made to move at a constant speed, depth/altitude and heading. The pilot can adjust position and heading without interrupting the flight.</li>
  <li><p></p><b>Compatibility</b>: VideoRay RI CoPilot is compatible with the latest upgrade of the Teledyne RDI (RS-232) DVL and BlueView P900 Sonar.</li>
  <li><p></p><b>Survey Module</b>: This core module comprises the additional navigation tools of Pathpoint and Waypoint, which allow the user to plan specific missions for the ROV with ease and precision.</li>
  <li><p></p><b>Sonar overlay for identification</b>: Visualize current field of view as captured by the sonar.</li>
  </ul>
