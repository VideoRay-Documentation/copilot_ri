<h1>Compass Calibration</h1>

<p>For best results with VideoRay CoPilot RI, the compass calibration should be completed to optimize its performance in your location.  If you have moved 1 degree of Latitude or more from your last operating location or if you are operating near a large ferrous object like a ship, you should calibrate the compass.  The compass calibration can be found in VideoRay Cockpit.</p>
