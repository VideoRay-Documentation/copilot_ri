<p>The VideoRay RI CoPilot pilot interface comprises four main elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p></p><b>Pilot Information Display</b>: The pilot information display is the column on the left side of the interface. It provides the pilot with vital information on the current status and operation of the ROV.</li>
  <li><p></p><b>Navigation Chart Display</b>: The navigation chart display is the main panel in the pilot interface. It allows the user to monitor the position of the ROV in real-time. It is also possible to use the navigation chart display to generate commands for the ROV by selecting coordinates with a mouse. A left-button mouse click in this display generates a new position request for the ROV, and a right-button mouse click generates a new heading request. The Navigation Chart Display can also be used to show sonar tracking. This allows the user to monitor the sonar field of view in real-time, identifying and classifying possible targets.</li>
  <li><p></p><b>Water Column Display</b>: The water column display is positioned on the right side of the interface, next to the navigation chart display. It allows the pilot to monitor and alter the depth/altitude of the ROV. A left-button mouse click in this display generates a new depth/altitude request for the ROV. A right-button mouse click has no effect in this display.</li>
  <li><p></p><b>Pilot Interface Toolbar</b>: The pilot interface toolbar allows the user to access the additional functionality of the interface that is not immediately visible.</li>
  </ul>
