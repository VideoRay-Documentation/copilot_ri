<h1>3 - Pilot Interface Overview</h1>

<p>The VideoRay RI CoPilot pilot interface presents the user with an overview of the ROV's status and its position in the navigation chart.  The overall look of the pilot interface is designed to be easy to read and intuitive to use.</p>

<p>The VideoRay RI CoPilot pilot interface comprises four main elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p></p><b>Pilot Information Display</b>: The pilot information display is the column on the left side of the interface. It provides the pilot with vital information on the current status and operation of the ROV.</li>
  <li><p></p><b>Navigation Chart Display</b>: The navigation chart display is the main panel in the pilot interface. It allows the user to monitor the position of the ROV in real-time. It is also possible to use the navigation chart display to generate commands for the ROV by selecting coordinates with a mouse. A left-button mouse click in this display generates a new position request for the ROV, and a right-button mouse click generates a new heading request. The Navigation Chart Display can also be used to show sonar tracking. This allows the user to monitor the sonar field of view in real-time, identifying and classifying possible targets.</li>
  <li><p></p><b>Water Column Display</b>: The water column display is positioned on the right side of the interface, next to the navigation chart display. It allows the pilot to monitor and alter the depth/altitude of the ROV. A left-button mouse click in this display generates a new depth/altitude request for the ROV. A right-button mouse click has no effect in this display.</li>
  <li><p></p><b>Pilot Interface Toolbar</b>: The pilot interface toolbar allows the user to access the additional functionality of the interface that is not immediately visible.</li>
  </ul>
