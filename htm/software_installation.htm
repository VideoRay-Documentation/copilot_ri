<h1>Software Installation</h1>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_caution.png"> Installation of VideoRay CoPilot RI is a complex process.  Improper installation can result in an unstable computer.  If you do have an intermediate or better understanding of installing and configuring software, contact VideoRay Technical Support for assistance.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> CoPilot setup currently REQUIRES that the logged in (and thus installing) user be named VideoRay.  This is standard on VideoRay provisioned production machines.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> This setup also requires systems using a ROV GPS Mast and DVL to have the device PAMS programmed with the standard ID's.  This may NOT be the case for some devices.  In which case they will HAVE to be reprogrammed with vrDeviceConf.  Please contact VideoRay Technical Support for assistance if necessary.</p>
