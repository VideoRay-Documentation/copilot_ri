<h1>Flight Controls Panel</h1>

<p>The Flight Controls Panel is used to select the flight mode and indicate which flight mode is active.  It is also used to select the desired speed of the ROV while operating in an auto flight mode.</p>

<p>Selecting a flight mode button changes the flight mode and the active button is displayed in yellow with a cyan outline.  Likewise, selecting a speed button changes the speed at which the ROV will operate when operating in an auto flight mode.  The selected speed is displayed in yellow with a cyan outline.</p>

<p>Flight Modes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stay</li>
  <li>Manual Mode</li>
  <li>Auto Hover</li>
  <li>Auto Fly</li>
  <li>Cruise</li>
  </ul>

<p>Speeds include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Slow (0.0125 m/s)</li>
  <li>Medium (0.25 m/s)</li>
  <li>Fast (0.5 m/s)</li>
  </ul>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> When the DP is in standby, the only mode enabled is MANUAL and the rest of the buttons are disabled.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> When using the joystick to override an auto mode (other than Cruise Mode, where the joystick override is not enabled), the ROV's maximum speed is still restricted by the speed selection.  If you want full power, you will need to change to Manual Mode.<p>
