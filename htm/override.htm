<h1>Override</h1>

<p>In order for VideoRay CoPilot RI to communicate with VideoRay Cockpit, Cockpit operates in override mode.  This allows CoPilot RI to send piloting commands to the ROV through Cockpit.  If the system becomes unstable while in an auto flight mode, the Override can be used to break this connection and return manual control to the pilot.</p>
