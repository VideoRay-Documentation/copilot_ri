<h2>2.3 VideoRay CoPilot RI Core Features</h2>

<P>The core features of VideoRay CoPilot RI are:.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p></p><b>Pilot Interface</b>: The VideoRay CoPilot RI pilot interface offers the visual aid of real-time monitoring. Its non-intrusive dark background enhances the display on screen and allows the user to extract vital real-time information for piloting.
  <li><p></p><b>Hover Command</b>: This command provides station-keeping at the touch of a button.</li>
  <li><p></p><b>Autohover Flight Mode</b>: In this mode the ROV switches automatically between MANUAL mode (when the joystick is in use) and HOVER (when the joystick is not in use).</li>
  <li><p></p><b>Autofly Flight Mode</b>: In this mode the ROV can be controlled through the enhanced joystick velocity controller or through the Click & Go interface. This mode also enables the alternative navigation tools of the Survey Module.</li>
  <li><p></p><b>Cruise Flight Mode</b>: In this mode the ROV can be made to move at a constant speed, depth/altitude and heading. The pilot can adjust position and heading without interrupting the flight.</li>
  <li><p></p><b>Compatibility</b>: VideoRay CoPilot RI is compatible with the latest upgrade of the Teledyne RDI (RS-232) DVL and BlueView P900 Sonar.</li>
  <li><p></p><b>Survey Module</b>: This core module comprises the additional navigation tools of Pathpoint and Waypoint, which allow the user to plan specific missions for the ROV with ease and precision.</li>
  <li><p></p><b>Sonar overlay for identification</b>: Visualize current field of view as captured by the sonar.</li>
  </ul>
