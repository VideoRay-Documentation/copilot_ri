<p>The velocity controls allow the user to select the desired speed of the ROV while in an auto flight mode.  The speeds are defined as slow (0.125 m/s), medium (0.25 m/s) and fast (0.5 m/s).</p>

<p>While in an auto flight mode, the speed can be reduced at any time, but the speed cannot be increased without first reverting to manual mode.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.png"> In manual mode, the speed setting is ignored, however when using the joystick to override an auto flight mode, the maximum speed will be restricted to the selected speed setting.</p>
