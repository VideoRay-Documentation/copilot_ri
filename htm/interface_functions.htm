<h2>7.1 Chart Loading</h2>

<p>The Chart Loader icon allows the user to add a vector chart to the navigation chart display. It can only display one chart at a time. The vector chart must be an AutoCAD<sup>&reg;</sup> 14 DXF file in UTM WGS84 format or an ENC chart and the chart must not exceed the boundaries of the relevant UTM zone.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> The Navigation Status indicator on the pilot information display must be green in order for the chart to be loaded. Please refer to section 6.2.4 - The Navigation Status Indicator for more information.</p>

<center><p><img src="../images/Figure%2037%20Loading%20a%20Chart.png"></p>
<p>Figure 37 - Loading a Chart</p>
</center>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> The user must know which UTM zone the chart was created in.</p>

<p>The Load Vector Chart dialog box comprises three steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p></p>Selecting the "Browse" button opens up a dialog box, through which DXF chart files may be selected. 
When the appropriate file is located and the "Open" button is selected, the chart is ready to be loaded, and the appropriate file name should appear in the file name display.</li>
  <li><p></p>When a valid file has been selected the filename will be displayed. The user must then select the correct UTM zone to position the chart using the drop-down lists.
    <p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> If an incorrect zone is chosen the chart will not be positioned correctly but may still appear in the view.</p></li>
  <li><p></p>The user must ensure that the vehicle position is correct before loading the vector chart. It the Navigation Status indicator is green, this step is optional. If the Navigation Status sensor is yellow or red, this step should be performed by selecting the "Set Vehicle Position" button.</li>
  </ol>

<p>Select the "Add" button to insert the chart on to the navigation chart display. Select the "Exit" button to close the dialog box.</p>

<h3>Removing a Chart</h2>

<p>Selecting the "Remove" button removes the current chart displayed in the navigation chart display. If no chart is present, no action is taken.</p>

<h2>7.2 Taking a Screenshot</h2>

<p>A screenshot of the current interface display can be taken by selecting the Screenshot icon. By selecting this icon, a screenshot of the current interface display will be captured and saved to the data directory.</p>

<h2>7.3 Log Recording</h2>

<p>The Log Recording icon allows the user to record a sequence of system activity into a file, which is automatically saved to the data directory. Once selected, the icon will blink to indicate recording in process.</p>

<p><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> Pressing the log button on the VideoRay hand-controller will trigger the same effect.</p>

<p>The process can be stopped, and the log completed, at any time by re-selecting the Log Recorder icon.</p>

<h2>7.4 External Position Fix</h2>

<p>By selecting the Change Vehicle Position menu item, the user is presented with two options:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p></p>Take a new position from external fix
  <p>If the system has been configured to receive the calculated global position of the ROV from an external positioning system, the user has the option to force VideoRay RI CoPilot to update its location for the vehicle from this external source.</p>
  <p>The pilot has the option to tell the navigation system to take a reading from this external source, if they consider it to be reliable at that time.</p>

  <li><p></p>Manually enter updated global position
  <p>This option allows the user to manually enter the global position of the ROV and update the navigation chart display.</li>

<center><p><img src="../images/Figure%2038%20External%20Position%20Fix.png"></p>
<p>Figure 38 - External Position Fix</p>
</center>

  <p>By checking the "remember this choice" box before exiting the dialog box, the system will store the details of the request and remember them the next time the user accesses the Change Vehicle Position menu item.  

  <li><p></p>Manually reset Navigation Origin
  <p>This option will reset the navigation system. This is useful when planning mission or adding markers where no global position is available. The user can re-use the same marker and/or mission data anywhere in the world.</li>
  </ol> 

<h2>7.5 Clearing Breadcrumb Trail</h2>

<p>As the ROV moves across the Pilot Interface, a breadcrumb trail will be left, highlighting the path of the vehicle. This path can be cleared by simply selecting the Clearing Breadcrumb Trail icon.</p>

<p><P><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> To disable the breadcrumb trail, refer to section: 7.6.3 Features</p>

<h2>7.6 Preferences</h2>

<p>The preferences icon can be located on the top right of your screen, above the waterfall. The preferences icon will allow users to control:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p></p>Units</li>
  <li><p></p>Joystick Calibration</li>
  <li><p></p>Features</li>
  <li><p></p>Vehicle</li>
  </ol>

<h3>7.6.1 Units</h3>

<p>The user can change the display measurement (position) units used in the interface to meters or feet. The velocity units can also be changed to m/s, ft/s or knots.</p>

<p><P><img src="../../required/images/icon_note.gif"> If the user changes the display measurements in cockpit, the effects will be evident throughout the system.</p>

<p>The global position can also be changed to decimal degrees, degrees and decimal minutes, or degrees, minutes and seconds.</p>

</center>

<h3>7.6.2 Joystick Calibration</h3>

<p>This menu item is used to calibrate the joystick that is currently connected to the VideoRay RI CoPilot system.</p>

<p>Caution: The joystick calibration should be completed before the ROV is ready to be operated - i.e. before it is in the water.</p>

<p>After selecting this item, the can configure the region in which the joystick will be classed as "deadstick."</p>

</center>

<h2>7.6.3 Features</h3>

<p>This menu item allows the user to enable or disable the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p></p>Range and Bearing Tool</li>
  <li><p></p>Breadcrumb Trail Enabled</li>
  <li><p></p>Tooltips Enabled</li>
  <li><p></p>Enable Station Keeping</li>
  <li><p></p>Enable Offline Planning</li>
  </ul>

<center><p><img src="../images/Figure%2041%20Features.png"></p>
<p>Figure 41 - Features</p>
</center>

<p>Station Keeping: In this mode the ROV will hover at the desired location.</p>

<p>Offline Planning: This mode allows the user to plan a survey mission (See section 6.2.3.4.2.) without the need of having the ROV deployed in water. The user is also able to add markers and make the vehicle move to the desired marker. See section Markers.</p>

<p>Each feature can be enabled or disabled by simply clicking on the tick box to the left of the description. A tick indicates the feature is enabled.</p>

<h3>7.6.4 Vehicle </h3>

<p>This menu item allows the user to set the position of the DVL by altering the coordinates contained within the boxes on the left hand side of the Preferences toolbar. The user must enter the correct settings for the DP system to perform smoothly.</p>

The sonar position and orientation can also be changed for display purpose.

</center>

<h2>7.7 Reset Sonar Comms</h2>

<p>If the user wishes to close any existing connections to the sonar and open a new connection, they can do so by simply clicking on the Reset Sonar Comms icon. This function should be utilized in instances when communication with the sonar has been interrupted, for example if the vehicle is restarted or there is a communications failure.</p>

<h2>7.8 Auto-Intensity On/Off</h2>

<p>By default, VideoRay RI CoPilot automatically adjusts the image intensity to produce an optimum image for most situations. However, there are some cases where you may wish to disable this feature. You can do so by un-checking Auto Intensity under the Pilot Interface Toolbar. With auto-intensity disabled, VideoRay RI CoPilot shows the horizontal Threshold and Intensity sliders in the toolbar.</p>

<h2>7.9 Colormap</h2>

<p>The colors used in displaying the sonar image are referred to as the colormap. The selected colormap for the image is displayed in a drop down box on the Pilot Interface toolbar. The following list describes the available colormaps and their characteristics. We recommend that you experiment with the different color maps to best understand their individual strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>COLORMAP</th>
    <th>CHARACTERISTICS</th>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cool</td>
    <td>Softer colors that work well in low light conditions.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Copper</td>
    <td>Great image definition and contrast. Best general purpose colormap.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Green</td>
    <td>Great image definition and contrast. Best general purpose colormap.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bone</td>
    <td>Best image definition, but low contrast makes it hard to use in bright sunlight conditions.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hot</td>
    <td>Good image definition and contrast. Good general purpose colormap.</td>
    </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jet</td>
    <td>High contrast with low image definition. Jet is ideal for quickly spotting targets in bright light conditions.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</p>

<h2>7.10 Intensity/Threshold</h2>

<p>Lowering the threshold will allow more of the background to be displayed in the image. Increasing the threshold will suppress background noise, increasing the contrast of the image. The intensity control affects the brightness of the image. This is similar to brightness controls on a camera. Setting the intensity too low or too high will make the image dim or blown out respectively, making image details difficult to see.</p>
