  <li><h3>Are there any operational limits of a CoPilot RI system?</h3>
  <p>Other than the general limits of a VideoRay Pro 4, the DVL operating range for bottom tracking is from 1 m (3 ft) to 80 m (260 ft).  Outside of this range the DVL may not be able to track the seafloor and VideoRay CoPilot's auto piloting features will not be available.  Also, the DVL is an acoustic system that relies on echoes off of the seafloor.  Some conditions such as heavy biological growth or being relatively close to a vertical wall may interfere with DVL tracking.</p></li>
