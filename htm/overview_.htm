<h1>Product Overview</h1>

<p>VideoRay CoPilot RI provides the latest generation of SMART software tools in a simple to use, pilot-friendly form. Learning to use VideoRay CoPilot RI is painless and the intuitive tools help novice users tackle even the most complex operations.</p>

<p>VideoRay CoPilot RI automates the VideoRay Pro 4 MicroROV control process. The ROV can efficiently maneuver through a mission, automatically reducing the consideration of the effects of currents. The ROV can also take better quality video pictures due to the improved stability when using VideoRay CoPilot RI.</p>

<p>Pilots normally control a VideoRay ROV using thruster inputs to navigate a desired course and speed. Constant adjustments are required to correct the course and account for water current and tether drag. Using VideoRay CoPilot RI, operators are able to identify objects suitable for tracking and can then maintain a stable heading and range to the target as desired, without the concern of current and tether drag.</p>

<h2>Dynamic Positioning System</h2>

<p>A Dynamic Positioning (DP) system allows the ROV to automatically hold a requested position or navigate to a selected location. A DP system mimics automatically what a pilot would do in adjusting the thrusters to keep the desired position.</p>

<p>The pilot can easily control the ROV using the DP system. For example, if the pilot maneuvers the joystick to the forwards position, the ROV will move forwards whilst automatically compensating for cross-currents and tether effects. 
VideoRay CoPilot RI enables object relative station-keeping and approach; the system will maintain a constant range to target whilst keeping the target at the center of the sonar field of view. The user can then perform object-relative advances / retreats (reduce or increase range to target); or change depth/altitude while keeping a constant distance from the target.</p>
