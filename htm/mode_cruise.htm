<p>In Cruise mode, CoPilot will attempt to maintain the ROV's speed and heading.  Once selected, Cruise will cause the ROV to begin navigating at the selected speed and current heading.  The user can issue right clicks on the Nav Chart to specify a new heading.  The user can issue left clicks in the Water Depth chart to change the ROV's objective depth (or altitude).</p>

<p>The user cannot use the joystick to override Auto Hover mode for horizontal and/or vertical control of the ROV.</p>

<p>In Position does not apply to Cruise mode.</p>

<p>To exit Auto Hover mode, select another Auto Fly Mode, Manual mode, or press the Stay command.  Pressing the Stay command will cause the system to enter Auto Fly mode.</p>
