NOTE:
A) Copilot setup currently REQUIRES that the logged in (and thus installing) user be named VideoRay.  This is standard on VideoRay provisioned produciton machines.

B) This setup also requires systems using a ROV GPS Mast and DVL to have the device PAMS programmed with the standard ID's.  This may NOT be the case for some device.  In which case they will HAVE to be reprogrammed with vrDeviceConf.  Please contact Andy or Marcus for assistance.
